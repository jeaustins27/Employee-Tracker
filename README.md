  ## Usage
To get started, clone the repo onto your machine. Once cloned, you will need to generate the database by using the prompts in the "schema.sql". You will then need to seed the database with the code in "seed.sql". Once your database has been created and seeded, you will need to install the necessary packages by using "npm install" in the command line. Once all packages have been installed, use "node server.js" in the command line to run the application. Use the arrow keys to navigate through the selections, to select press the ENTER key.
